Magic Square:
n x n matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2

Sum of any row, col, or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same number -> magic constant

3 x 3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1,9]

Can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1,9] at cost of |a - b|

Convert into a magic square at minimal cost

Find min cost

s = [[5, 3, 4], [1, 5, 8], [6, 4, 2]]

5 3 4
1 5 8
6 4 2

Convert to:

8 3 4
1 5 9
6 7 2

Takes 3 replacements
Cost: |5-8| + |8-9| + |4-7| = 7

= 3 + 1 + 3 = 7

returns the int min total cost of conversion to magic square

4 9 2
3 5 7
8 1 5


Note: Each row needs to add up to 15 to be a magic square
Middle number must be 5!

So we must set the middle number to 5! 
What's the mid index in a 3X3 matrix?

s[row][col] -> s[1][1]
Set s[1][1] = 5

Since we know 5 is s[1][1], the sum of each opposite side MUST be equal to 10

X X X
X 5 X
X X X

if 9 is corner index
   the other numbers in the row MUST BE 2 and 4 as they add up to 6
  

Edges? 
s[0][0]
s[2][0]
s[0][2]
s[2][2]

9 must be an edge index!
9 must be in a middle row or middle col

There are 8 possible combinations for a magic square

The middle rows will be either 3 and 7 or 1 and 9



Get the row total of each row

How can we convert all the rows to be 15?

corners must be 4, 2, 6, 8

Corners
s[0][0]
s[2][0]
s[0][2]
s[2][2]

middle row and column must be either 9 5 1 or 7 5 3

Diagonals must be 2 5 8 and 4 5 6

for each row in rows
   for each col in cols
       list of corner indexes -> remove once used
       if corner index, is number 4, 2, 6, or 8?
          if not, convert to number not yet used
          remove number from list of corner indexes
          if yes, move to next col
          


5 3 4
1 5 8
6 4 2

Could generate all possible magic squares?
