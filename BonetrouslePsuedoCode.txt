Build a collection with starting values? (1 - b)
Add the values in collection
If sum > n, return -1
If sum is equal to n, return collection
If sum of collection < n
   start at b
   difference = n - sum of collection
   b + diff = sum?
   Add difference to last element of collection
   Check if new element is less than or equal to k
   return new collection
   If not greater than k set element to k and k-1
   repeat with next element
   If I run out of elements, return -1
