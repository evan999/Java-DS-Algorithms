s = mnonopoo

A string is said to be a special string if either of two conditions is met:

1) All chars are the same
OR
2) All chars except middle one are the same

Special substring - any substr of a str which meets one of the two above criteria.

Problem: How many special substrings can be formed from the str?

s = mnonopoo

special substrs = [m, n, o, n, o, p, o, o, non, ono, opo, oo]

Edge cases:

if char is of length = 1
	special substr


1. Extract all substrs from the str (there CAN be duplicates)
2. Determine which substrs are "special substrs"
	-Check for substrs with just 1 char length. All 1 char strs are special substrs
	-Check for substrs with 1 char repeated -> Special substrs as they meet criteria #1 of special substrs
	-> All chars are the same
	-Check for substrs with two chars, one repeated on both sides, and one in the middle
		-Find middle char and compare both sides of the substr
